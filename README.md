# Remind Med!
Remind Med! is a mobile application developed on React Native, aimed at making taking medications easier and more straightforward. It has the capability of reading handwritten medical prescriptions and automatically generating alerts to remind you to take your medications at the right time. This was developed during the Guadalahacks Hackathon of 2024.
